# Generating N-Puzzle Instances

In this instance we are generating 1000 test cases for testing the codes. 
**N-Puzzle** accepts five separate Search Algorithms based on Graphs. The first three are Algorithms for **Uninformed Search**:

* Breadth-first search for search
* Depth-first Quest for Depth-first
* Quest for Iterative Deepening


The other two are Algorithms for Informed Search:

* A* Search
* Greedy Search

If we select a Informed Search Algorithm, a Heuristic Function would still need to be selected.

**Heuristic Function**
Three separate Heuristic Functions are provided by N-Puzzle:


* Euclidean Distance
* Manhattan Distance
